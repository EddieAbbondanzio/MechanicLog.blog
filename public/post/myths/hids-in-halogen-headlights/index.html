<p>Older vehicles, especially those from the 90s and older are plagued with dim halogen headlights. Dim headlights can make it a real challenge to drive at night, even more so for those who live out in the country.</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/myths/hids-in-halogen-headlights/hids.jpg"></p>

<p>HID (high intensity discharge) headlights are an alternative to halogens and have become common in newer cars. If you&rsquo;ve spent anytime behind the wheel you&rsquo;ve likely seen them in action, and perhaps even envious of the extra light.</p>

<p>It’s not just the color that makes them appear brighter, they also give off 30% more lumens. A lumen is the SI unit of light brightness and can be thought of as the amount of light that a small candle approximately one foot away emits. For anyone looking for a quick upgrade, all the cheap “plug and play” kit on sites such as Ebay sounds like a no brainer, but are they really?</p>

<p>There’s a lot of engineering behind the design of your car’s headlights. They’re designed to optimize the light output of a specific bulb, that has a specific focal point. The focal point of a light bulb is the point at which all light is emitted from.</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/myths/hids-in-halogen-headlights/halogen.jpg"></p>

<p>While HIDs may come in the same sizes as standard halogen bulbs (H1, H3, etc…) this only guarantees the base of the bulb will fit. Aftermarket HIDs do not have a standardized focal point and this causes the light distribution of the housing to scatter. This is what causes glare that blinds other drivers at night.</p>

<p>Headlight housings have adjusters on them that allow for repositioning the housing vertically, or horizontally, but aiming the housing downwards to compensate the HIDs is not a safe solution. The glare produced by HIDs will still be obnoxious and dangerous to other drivers, and with the headlights pointing downwards you lose the extra distance provided by the HIDs effectively canceling out the “upgrade” over halogens.</p>

<p>If you’re still dead set on upgrading to HIDs your best bet is to do a projector retrofit. Companies such as <a href="https://www.theretrofitsource.com/">The Retrofit Source</a> have been selling kits for years now, and for some vehicle models they offer direct bolt in solutions. Projectors help tame HIDs by creating a crisp cutoff to prevent from blinding other drivers on the road.</p>
