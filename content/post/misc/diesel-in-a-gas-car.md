A local gas station recently had a delivery screw up causing diesel fuel to be dumped into the gasoline tanks that supplied their fuel pumps. The station was quick to catch the mistake, but not before a few unlucky commuters had a nasty surprise.

While delivery mistakes are fairly uncommon, it’s not unheard of for a driver to accidentally fill up their vehicle with the wrong fuel. Even though diesel pumps are different in color and size, and diesel gives off a different smell it still happens.

With that said, what exactly does occur when a gasoline vehicle receives a hearty dose of diesel into it’s system? Surprisingly nothing at first. With the gas tank located in the rear of the vehicle fuel must be transported to the engine via long fuel lines that traverse the length of the car. For the first few miles after the tainted fill up the engine will use up all of the clean gasoline in the fuel lines. 

At the same time however, the fuel pump is still doing it’s job of pumping fluid from the gas tank into the fuel lines. Since diesel is denser than gas it will sink to the bottom of the tank allowing the fuel pump to suck it up first.

Once the diesel finally reaches the engine bay things begin to get interesting. The first engine component they’ll encounter are the injectors. Injectors provide the engine with fuel by spraying small bursts of it into either the intake manifold, or directly into the cylinders if your vehicle has direct injection. The injectors won’t be too happy about pumping in the diesel gas mixture but they’ll still function and manage to inject the mixture into the engine.

Now, depending on how much diesel was put into the fuel tank things will vary. If a large amount of diesel was placed into the fuel tank then the mixture being injected into the engine will be more diesel than fuel and the engine won’t be able to combust it. Diesel and gasoline are both petroleum based fuels but each combusts in a slightly different manner. 

Diesel engines combust fuel by compressing it in a very high pressure environment. Gasoline engines on the other hand have 1 to 2 spark plugs per cylinder that emit an electrical spark to ignite the gasoline within them. Diesel cannot be ignited via a spark, and gasoline engines have a compression ratio that is too low to ignite the diesel causing the motor to sputter out. This is the better of the two scenarios as the vehicle will only need a thorough cleansing of it’s fuel system before it can be driven again but there will be no lasting damage. 

If a gasoline vehicle receives only a slight amount of diesel the outcome takes a major turn for the worse. With only a small amount of diesel in the fuel the mixture will act similar to very very low grade gas. Gasoline is rated by it’s octane number and is the reason why you see the 87, 89, 91, and/or 93 buttons on the fuel pumps . The higher in octane the gas is, then the higher the compression the fuel can withstand before it ignites. When diesel is mixed into gasoline it causes the octane rating to drop severely.

Gasoline engines wait for roughly the moment the piston reaches TDC (top dead center) before igniting fuel via a small electrical charge from the spark plug. When fuel in an cylinder ignites before reaching TDC it’s known as engine knock. A common cause of engine knock is gasoline with too low of an octane rating igniting due to the high compression it’s experiencing. This is the reason why high performance, or forced induction engines require a higher octane fuel.

Engine knock causes serious wear on the engine’s internals as the engine is attempting to push the piston up, while at the same time the combustion forces are attempting to push the piston down. 

If the driver is observant and notices the engine is running rough, lacking power, and probably flashing a CEL (check engine light), they’ll pull over and shut off the engine before it’s too late. 

If the driver does not shut off the engine and continues on they’ll risk destroying their engine. There’s a good chance not all of the diesel fuel will be combusted which can lead to deposits building up on the pistons, and valves, or worse causing the engine to [hydrolock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolock).

Some diesel may manage to seep past the piston rings allowing it to containment the oil that lubricates the lower half of the engine. The containment oil won’t be as lubricating which will cause further wear on the bearings of the engine that are already taking a beating from the repetitive misfires. 

Diesel will also likely find it’s way into the exhaust system, and once it reaches the catalytic converter it will ignite destroying the fine honey comb structure within it. This will drop the efficiency of the cat, and eventually cause it to clog up. At this point the driver is looking at a very expensive repair bill. 

At the end of the day if you accidentally put diesel in your gasoline powered vehicle play it safe and don’t drive it. Call a tow truck and either have it towed to a mechanic’s shop or if your handy to your own garage where you can properly drain the fuel tank. It’s not worth the risk, or the expensive bill that comes along with it.
