A local gas station recently had a delivery mix up causing diesel fuel to be dumped into the gasoline tanks that supply their fuel pumps. The station was quick to catch the mistake, but not before a few unlucky commuters had a nasty surprise.

While delivery mishaps are rare, it’s not unheard of for a driver to accidentally fill up their vehicle with the wrong fuel. Even though diesel pumps are different in color and size, and diesel gives off a different smell it still happens.

With that said, what exactly happens when a gasoline vehicle receives a hearty dose of diesel? Surprisingly nothing at first. With the gas tank located in the rear of the vehicle fuel must be transported to the engine via long fuel lines that traverse the entire length of the car. For the first few miles after the fill up the engine will still be running on the clean gasoline in the fuel lines. 

However, the fuel pump is still doing it’s job of pumping fluid from the gas tank into the fuel lines and the bad fuel begins to make it's way to the engine. Since diesel is denser than gas it will sink to the bottom of the tank allowing the fuel pump to suck it up first.

Once the diesel reaches the engine bay things get interesting. The first engine component it'll encounter are the injectors. Injectors provide the engine with fuel by spraying small bursts of it into either the intake manifold, or directly into the cylinders if your vehicle has direct injection. The injectors won’t be too happy about pumping in the diesel/gas mixture but they’ll still function and manage to inject the mixture into the engine.

# Sputter Out

Now, depending on how much diesel was put into the fuel tank things will vary. If a large amount of diesel was placed into the fuel tank then the mixture being injected into the engine will be more diesel than gas and the engine won’t be able to combust it. Diesel and gasoline are both petroleum based fuels but each combusts in a slightly different manner. 

Diesel engines combust fuel by compressing it in a very high pressure environment. Gasoline engines on the other hand have 1 to 2 spark plugs per cylinder that emit an electrical ark to ignite the gasoline. Diesel cannot be ignited via a spark, and since gasoline engines have a compression ratio that is too low to ignite the diesel the motor will sputter out. This is the better of the two possibilities as the vehicle will only need a thorough cleansing of it’s fuel system before it can be driven again and there will be no lasting damage. 

# Catastrophic Failure

If a gasoline vehicle receives only a slight amount of diesel the outcome takes a turn for the worse. With only a small amount of diesel in the fuel the mixture will act similar to very very low grade gas. Gasoline is rated by it’s octane number and is the reason why you see the 87, 89, 91, and/or 93 buttons on the fuel pumps. The higher in octane the gas is, then the higher the compression the fuel can withstand before it ignites. When diesel is mixed into gasoline it causes the octane rating to drop severely.

Gasoline engines wait for roughly the moment the piston reaches TDC (top dead center) before igniting fuel via a small electrical charge from the spark plug. When fuel ignites before the piston reaches TDC it causes [engine knock](https://repairpal.com/engine-knocking). A common cause of engine knock is gasoline with too low of an octane rating igniting prematurely due to high compression. This is the reason why high performance, or forced induction engines often require a higher octane fuel.

Engine knock causes serious wear on the engine’s internals as the engine is attempting to push the piston up, while at the same time the combustion forces are attempting to push the piston down. An engine experiencing knock will often have a sporadic idle, and lack of power.

If the driver is observant and notices the engine is running rough, lacking power, and probably flashing a CEL (check engine light), they’ll pull over and shut off the engine before it’s too late. If the engine is not shut off they’ll risk destroying it, and need a full rebuild.

There’s a good chance not all of the diesel will be combusted which can lead to deposits building up on the pistons, and valves, or worse cause the engine to [hydrolock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolock).

Some diesel may manage to seep past the piston rings allowing it to containment the oil that lubricates the lower half of the engine. The containment oil won’t be as lubricating which will cause further wear on the bearings of the engine that are already taking a beating from the repetitive misfires. 

Diesel will also likely find it’s way into the exhaust system, and once it reaches the catalytic converter it will ignite destroying the fine honey comb structure within it. This will drop the efficiency of the cat, and eventually cause it to clog up. At this point the driver is looking at a very expensive repair bill. 

# In The End - Don't Drive It

If you accidentally put diesel in your gasoline vehicle play it safe and don’t drive it. Call a tow truck and have it towed to a mechanic who can safely drain the fuel tank, and purge the lines of any remaining diesel.
